### 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞, 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰 <𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜/>! 👋
I'm Lakshmi, a full-stack developer with a keen eye for creating engaging content that bring products to life. I love working on everything from the server to the front-end and enjoy breaking down complex problems into simple nuggets of code. I have experience developing web applications that utilize React, Redux, and PostgreSQL.

When not coding, I'm usually hiking, kayaking, or reading a modern fairy tale.
